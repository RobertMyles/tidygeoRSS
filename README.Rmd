# tidygeoRSS üåé üåç üåè

<!-- badges: start -->

The idea of tidygeoRSS is to parse 'geo' feeds -- RSS, Atom and JSON -- and return them as tibbles complete with the geographical information in a way that is compatible with the [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) library. 

For more information on these formats, see: 

- geo-RSS & geo-Atom: [http://www.georss.org/](http://www.georss.org/)  
- geoJSON: [https://geojson.org/](https://geojson.org/)

## Installation

You can install the released version of tidygeoRSS from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidygeoRSS")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RobertMyles/tidygeoRSS")
```

### Installing sf

tidygeoRSS relies on sf, which also relies on some system dependencies, so you will most likely have to install certain things before using tidygeoRSS. More information is available [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html#installing).
