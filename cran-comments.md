# tidygeoRSS v0.0.1

Fixed as per request: 
- fixed spelling of 'geoRSS' to be consistent across documentation (capitalised as 'GeoRSS' in DESCRIPTION title only)
- added return value to function documentation
- added example ('# Not run' because of HTTP GET call)
- removed redundant 'for R' from title.

- (2020-06-09): removed 'geo-RSS' from DESCRIPTION and replaced with 'geo'. This removes the usage of both 'geoRSS' and 'geo-RSS', and makes it clearer that the package is not only for RSS, but Atom and JSON feeds too.
